Several sysex checksum calculations exist:
------------------------------------------

Universal SysEx Checksum calculation:
-------------------------------------
The checksum field, where present, is calculated by successively XOR'ing the
bytes in the message, excluding the F0, F7, and the checksum field. The 
resulting value is then AND'ed with 7F, to create a 7 bit value.


Roland SysEx Checksum calculation:
----------------------------------
Add the 'data' bytes in the message (starting after the command Id up to -but 
not including the checksum) and devide by 80(h). Then subtract the value from
80(h) to calculate the checksum value.

Official Roland Documentation:
The checksum is a value derived by adding the address, size and checksum itself and
inverting the lower 7 bits. Here's an example of how the checksum is calculated. We will
assume that in the exclusive message we are transmitting, the address is aa bb and the data
or size is ccH.
aa + bb + cc = sum
sum / 128 = quotient ... remainder
128 - remainder = checksum
<Example> Setting DETUNE to DEPTH 4
According to the “Parameter Address Map,” the DETUNE Address is 01 20H, and DEPTH 4
is a value of 40H. Thus,
F0 41 00 1A 12 01 20 40 ?? F7
(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) address data checksum (6)
(1) Exclusive Status, (2) ID (Roland), (3) Device ID (UNIT#-1),
(4) Model ID (C-80), (5) Command ID (DT1), (6) End of Exclusive
* UNIT# must be set to the same channel as the basic channel. The basic channel is ch. 1 in
the example message above.
Next we calculate the checksum.
01H + 20H + 40H = 1 + 32 + 64 = 97 (sum)
97 (sum) / 128 = 0 (quotient) ... 97 (remainder)
checksum = 128 - 97 (remainder) = 31 = 1FH
This means that F0 41 00 1A 12 01 20 40 1F F7 is the message we transmit.
