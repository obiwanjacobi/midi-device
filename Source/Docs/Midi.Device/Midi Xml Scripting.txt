Midi Scripting

Using Xml to construct a language for scripting midi tasks (similar to (N)ant and MSBuild).
Perhaps we could use Xaml (object instantiation script) to implement it?

Performing operations is based on Xml tags that are implemented by code handlers.
Data is stored in a 'var' tag that also stored the data type and can cast or convert.
